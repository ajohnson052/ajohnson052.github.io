        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          This website is meant to provide a glimpse of my most recent thoughts, projects and interests. I first created this site in 2015 while taking a web development immersive class at General Assembly. That class was my gateway into the tech world, a world which I find thrilling and challenging and wonderful. At this moment I am looking to the future, eager to see where I will be able to apply my new-found skills. The possibilities are infinite!

          <p>For my first project at GA, I created a memory game. This was a really fun project to work on because the simple design allowed me to concentrate on the functionality of the game. It was my first dive into Javascript and jQuery, and I relied heavily on scripts while keeping the HTML and CSS very brief.</p>

          <p>Escapades is an app for making travel plans. Users can create trip ideas, and the app will help them choose the optimal dates for the trip based on their friends' availability. This app was created in Ruby on Rails and uses PostgreSQL. Devise and CanCanCan were used for user authentification and authorization. Carrierwave is used for uploading images, and Amazon Web Service's s3 is used to store those images. The app is deployed on heroku. An interesting part of this project was setting up the database and creating the schema. The app includes seven different models in order to facillitate a variety of user actions.</p>

          <p>DC Hoods was my final project for WDI at GA. The concept for the project developed out of my experience as an urban studies major, where I often had difficulty finding data available at the neighborhood level. I wanted to highlight patterns in the urban landscape by separating various assets by neighborhood boundaries. Hopefully, this approach will promote conversation about the uneven distribution of resources within the city. This is a Rails app that uses Backbone on the front end. It was my first project to center around mapping, and I really enjoyed working with geographic data. It is soemthing I hope to do more of in the future.</p>

          <p>Unhactivate was a collborative project between several other students at GA. I really enjoyed the collaborative nature of this project. I was able to learn a lot from the other developers on my team, and I gained a better understanding of efficient git workflows for teams. In addition, this was the first time I used ActionMailer to enable email notifications.

          <h2>Friendship Approval using CanCanCan</h2>
          <div class="post">
            <p>This is a tutorial for adding friendship approval to a Rails application. To begin, we will assume that the application already has functioning User and Friendship models. (I used Devise to create the User model.) However, we will add in a new “Tempship” model so that it is easy to manage temporary friends separately from approved friends. For anyone who does not have a functioning Friendship model, the approach for creating a new one is very similar to the approach we will use for Tempships. In order to manage authorization, we will use the Ruby gem CanCanCan.</p>
            <p>First we will run a new migration for our Tempship model.</p>
            <i>In the console</i>
            <pre class="code" class="code">
$ rails generate migration CreateTempships
            </pre>
            <p>Tempships will be a join table for associating two users. As such, the table should have a user_id column (this will represent the person who requested the friendship) and a temp_id column (representing the person who will need to approve the friend request). In db/migrate, a new migration will have been generated by the previous command. Edit that file to include the two column headings. It may also be useful to include a timestamp, although it is not essential for the functionality we are covering here.</p>
            <pre class="code">
class CreateTableTempships < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :table_tempships do |t|
      t.integer :user_id
      t.integer :temp_id
      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
            </pre>
            <p>We also need to define a Tempship model representing a many-to-many relationship between users. In order to reference a second user, we will use the alias &quot;temp&quot;. Create a new file called tempship.rb in app/models.</p>
            <i>In app/models/tempship.rb</i>
            <pre class="code">
class Tempship < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :temp, class_name: "User"
  validates_uniqueness_of :temp, scope: :user
end
            </pre>
            <p>Our User model must be updated to account for tempships. I find it useful if the user making the request and the user receiving the request both have new associations when a request is made. To make this happen, we can include inverse_tempships. This is very similar to the way that one might create a Friendship model.</p>
            <i>In app/models/user.rb add</i>
            <pre class="code">
has_many :tempships
has_many :temps, through: :tempships
has_many :inverse_tempships, class_name: "Tempship", foreign_key: "temp_id"
has_many :inverse_temps, through: :inverse_tempships, source: :user
            </pre>
            <p>At this point, the Tempship model is fully formed, but we will need a controller to create new tempships. Create a new file called tempships_controller in app/controllers.</p>
            <i>In app/controllers/tempships_controller</i>
            <pre class="code">
class TempshipsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @temp = User.find(params[:temp_id])
    @tempship = current_user.tempships.build(temp_id: params[:temp_id])
    @tempship.save
    redirect_to user_path(@temp)
  end
end
            </pre>
            <p>For the above create function to work properly, it is necessary that we have our routes defined appropriately. (Note that I am also assuming that the user model has an email attribute. However, it may be more appropriate use @temp.username in place of @temp.email if a username attribute exists.)</p>
            <i>In config/routes.rb</i>
            <pre class="code">
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users
  resources :users
  resources :friendships
  resources :tempships
end
            </pre>
            <p>The above creates additional routes that we will not be using here, but they may be useful for future development. If you are not planning on any further development, you can restrict the routes being created. We now have access to the tempships_path for creating a new tempship. Given the variable @user (referencing an instance of User) within one of our views, we can create a link to our create path as follows:</p>
            <pre class="code">
<%= link_to "Add #{@user.email} to my friends", tempships_path(temp_id: @user), method: :post %>
            </pre>
            <p>This will automatically create a new tempship between the current user and @user before redirecting to @user’s profile. In the new tempship, @user is referenced via the temp_id while the current user is referenced via the user_id.</p>
            <p>Next we need to modify our friendship create method so that users can only add friends by confirming friend requests. To do this we will use CanCanCan. </p>
            <p>First, install the CanCanCan gem.</p>
            <i>In Gemfile</i>
            <pre class="code">
gem ‘cancancan'
            </pre>
            <i>In the console</i>
            <pre class="code">
$ bundle install
            </pre>
            <p>Next we need to create a place to store permissions that CanCanCan will access. Create an ability.rb file to serve this purpose.</p>
            <i>In the console</i>
            <pre class="code">
$ rails g cancan:ability
            </pre>
            <p>We will now specify who has permission to create friendships. In order for someone to create a friendship, we want that there exist a tempship between the current user and the ‘friend’. We also want that the friend (and not the current user) created that tempship.</p>
            <i>In app/models/ability.rb</i>
            <pre class="code">
class Ability
  include CanCan::Ability
  def initialize(user)
    can :create, Friendship, Friendship do |friendship|
      Tempship.find_by(temp_id: user.id, user_id: friendship.friend_id)
    end
  end
end
            </pre>
            <p>The above can be read as, "The current user (user) is authorized to create the friendship being passed into this method if the following code is true of that friendship: 'Tempship.find_by...'". Finally, we must check that a user is authorized to create a friendship within the friendship create method.</p>
            <i>In app/controllers/friendships_controller.rb</i>
            <pre class="code">
def create
  @friend = User.find(params[:friend_id])
  @friendship = current_user.friendships.build(friend_id: params[:friend_id])
  authorize! :create, @friendship
  @friendship.save
  destroy_tempship
  redirect_to user_path(@friend)
end
            </pre>
            <p>CanCanCan provides the authorize method. The current user will be passed in as 'user', and his authorization will be tested for the create method of the Friendship model, given the instance of Friendship being passed in.</p>
            <p>Further considerations: error handling and flash notices for successful requests, restrictions on adding yourself as your own friend, option to delete/ignore friend requests, restrictions on creating requests if prior requests have been ignored</p>
